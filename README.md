# Smart Lecturer Availability & Navigation Systen
This project is a smart online appointment scheduling and navigation system that makes it simple for students to schedule an appointment with university staff members. This web-based application solves the problem of scheduling and managing appointments depending on user preferences.  The process of manually scheduling user appointments based on availability might occasionally become quite exhausting for the student or staff member.  Therefore, this project provides a useful solution that allows students to explore different booking slots and choose their desired time and date. The slot that has already been booked will be marked and will not be open to anybody else for the designated period of time.  Users can also cancel their reservation at any moment with this system.
