# Agile Development Plan

## Agile Methodology Chosen  
**Scrum**

We’ve chosen Scrum as our Agile methodology because it supports teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal. It fits well with our vision of gradually building and improving our mobile system over a series of focused sprints.

## Project Overview

**Smart Lecturer Availability & Navigation System**  
We’re building a Smart Lecturer Availability & Navigation System — a mobile-friendly solution that helps students
check if a lecturer is available (via IoT or manual updates), book appointments, and get real-time navigation to their
office. The system also includes scheduling features, push notifications, and uses GPS or indoor positioning for navigation.
It’s designed to make life easier for both students and lecturers by improving communication and reducing wasted trips.
