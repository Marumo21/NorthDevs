## Justification

### Backend: Node.js with Express (TypeScript)
- **Node.js** is a non-blocking, event-driven runtime ideal for scalable and lightweight backend services.
- **Express** provides a minimalist yet powerful routing and middleware framework.
- **TypeScript** adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code reliability and maintainability.
- The use of middleware, route handlers, and modular architecture encourages clean code organization.

### Frontend: React.js with Vite
- **React** allows the development of dynamic, component-driven UIs with efficient DOM updates.
- **Vite** offers a fast, modern development environment with instant hot module replacement and optimized production builds.
- Modular code structure makes the frontend maintainable and testable.
- Ecosystem support includes React Router for routing, Lucide for icons, and hooks for state management.

### Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Utility-first approach promotes rapid styling directly within JSX.
- Responsive design is easier to implement without leaving the component scope.
- Integrates seamlessly with Vite and React.

### Database: PostgreSQL
- An open-source relational database system known for performance and reliability.
- ACID compliance ensures data integrity, while support for advanced queries and indexing improves performance.
- Scales well for small- to large-scale applications.

### ORM: Prisma
- Type-safe database access using auto-generated types based on your schema.
- Schema migrations and modeling are efficient and developer-friendly.
- Integrates well with TypeScript and PostgreSQL.

### API Communication
- Current setup uses **RESTful APIs** for client-server communication.
- Future-proofed for **GraphQL** support if client-side flexibility is needed.
- Secure endpoints with JWT-based authentication.

### Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Stateless, token-based authentication suitable for modern SPAs.
- Simplifies session handling and API security.

### Hosting

#### Vercel (Frontend)
- Optimized for frontend frameworks like React and Next.js.
- Instant preview URLs for branches and pull requests.
- Built-in CDN, serverless support, and CI/CD pipelines.

#### Railway (Backend & Database)
- Developer-centric cloud platform for backend APIs and databases.
- One-click deployments, secrets management, and auto-scaling.
- PostgreSQL provisioning built-in.
